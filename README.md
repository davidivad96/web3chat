# React Boilerplate

Basic boilerplate for React with TypeScript. It comes configured with Webpack as the bundler, Babel to transpile modern JavaScript, and ESLint and Prettier to format and clean code.

## Why not use `create-react-app`?

- `create-react-app` adds so much code that maybe you don't need.
- If you want more flexibility or dig deeper into Webpack or Babel configuration, `create-react-app` is not the best option. You could eject the app, but still you would have a lot of stuff you probably don't need.
- This boilerplate is more suitable for my needs and preferences as programmer :)

## How to run

In the project directory, execute the following command to start a development server:

`yarn start`

If you want to serve an optimized production build, just run:

`yarn build && yarn serve`

In either case, just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
